This repository contains a collection of quantitative finance and computational projects completed during my tenure at Quant Club, IIT Kharagpur.
The work spans multiple areas of applied mathematics, financial modeling, and algorithmic problem-solving, including:

2048 Game Solver – Implementing heuristic and search-based algorithms for optimal gameplay.

Portfolio Optimization – Constructing and analyzing efficient portfolios using modern portfolio theory.

Pricing American Options – Implementing advanced Monte Carlo and regression-based methods (including signature-based LSMC) for option valuation.

Each project is designed to explore real-world quantitative methods through simulation, optimization, and applied programming.
